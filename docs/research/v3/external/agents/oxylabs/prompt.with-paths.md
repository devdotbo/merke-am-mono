### Provider Research Prompt — Oxylabs (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` covering Oxylabs solutions for X/Twitter (Scraper API, Residential/Datacenter proxies, Web Unblocker).

Include sections per shared context with dated citations; emphasize SLAs, pricing units, and compliance statements.

Suggested queries:
- "site:oxylabs.io pricing"
- "site:oxylabs.io docs twitter OR x.com scraper"
- "Oxylabs Web Unblocker twitter"
- "Oxylabs SLA uptime"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References.
