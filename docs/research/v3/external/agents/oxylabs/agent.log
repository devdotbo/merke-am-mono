I found the shared context and used it to structure the deliverable. Iâ€™ve drafted and saved the Oxylabs report.

- Wrote `report.md` to `docs/research/v3/external/agents/oxylabs/` with required sections: executive summary, coverage, rate limits/latency, pricing model with 1M-post scenario assumptions, reliability/SLA emphasis, compliance, implementation notes, and dated references.
