### Open‑Source Baseline Prompt — twscrape (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` on twscrape: capabilities for X/Twitter, maintenance status, setup/auth, pagination, retries/backoff, anti‑bot considerations, observability, and maintenance burden.

Suggested queries:
- GitHub repo: commits, issues, releases
- "twscrape twitter scraper login auth"
- "twscrape pagination rate limit"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References and retrieval dates.
