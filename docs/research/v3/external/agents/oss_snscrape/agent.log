I'll open the shared context file to align with your framework and then draft `report.md` accordingly.

I'll check the directory structure to locate the shared context file, then read it from the correct path.

I'll draft the snscrape external-only baseline report covering coverage, maintenance/health, setup, pagination, retries/backoff, anti-bot handling, observability, and maintenance burden, then write it to `report.md` in the specified directory.

- I read the shared `context.md` and drafted the external-only baseline report for `snscrape`, then wrote it to `oss_snscrape/report.md`.

- Key outputs:
  - Coverage, maintenance/health, setup/auth, pagination guidance.
  - Retry/backoff and anti-bot recommendations.
  - Observability/maintenance burden and compliance notes.
  - References with retrieval dates.

If you want a deeper dive (e.g., mapped fields to a normalized schema or sample wrapper code with backoff), I can extend the report.
