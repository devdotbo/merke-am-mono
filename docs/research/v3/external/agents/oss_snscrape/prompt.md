### Open‑Source Baseline Prompt — snscrape (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` on snscrape: coverage, maintenance, setup, pagination, retries/backoff, anti‑bot handling, and maintenance burden.

Suggested queries:
- GitHub repo: commits, issues, releases
- "snscrape twitter x.com search timeline"
- "snscrape rate limits"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References and retrieval dates.
