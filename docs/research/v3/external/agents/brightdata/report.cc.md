### 1. Coverage & Features for X/Twitter

Bright Data provides specialized Twitter scraping through multiple API endpoints:

**Twitter Posts API** [Vendor documentation, retrieved 2025-01-24]

- Engagement metrics: replies, reposts, likes, views, bookmarks
- Media content: external images, videos, hashtags
- Parent post details for thread context
- Discovery by profile URL with date range filtering (MM-DD-YYYY format)
- API limitation: Up to 1,000 posts per input

**Twitter Profiles API** [Vendor documentation, retrieved 2025-01-24]
- Profile information: x_id, URL, profile name, biography, verification status
- Engagement data: followers, following, subscriptions
- Profile metadata: date joined, location, birth date, posts count
- Business/government account indicators

- Asynchronous scraping (`/trigger`): For batch processing up to 5,000 URLs average
- Bulk request handling for high-volume operations
- Automatic data parsing and validation

### 2. Rate Limits and Latency

**Rate Limits** [Vendor-claimed, Bright Data docs, retrieved 2025-01-24]:
- Up to 20 inputs per request: **1,500 concurrent requests**
- Over 20 inputs per request: **100 concurrent requests**
- No specific per-second rate limits documented
- No usage limits mentioned for the API itself

**Latency** [Vendor-claimed, various sources, retrieved 2025-01-24]:
- Residential proxies: 0.7-second average response time
- General response time: Under 0.3 seconds for proxy connections
- No specific latency metrics provided for Twitter API endpoints
- Real-time processing for synchronous requests up to 20 URLs

**Legal precedent on rate limiting** [Octoparse blog, retrieved 2025-01-24]:
- Meta v. Bright Data ruling noted "respectful 2-3 second delays between requests as evidence of legitimate use"

### 3. Pricing Model and Tiers

**Pricing Structure** [Vendor pricing pages, retrieved 2025-01-24]:

| Tier | Price per 1K Records | Monthly Minimum | Discount Code |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Pay-as-you-go | $1.50 | No commitment | N/A |
| Growth | $0.95 (was $1.27) | $499 | APIS25 (25% off) |

| Premium | $0.79 (was $1.05) | $1,999 | APIS25 (25% off) |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | N/A |

**1M Posts/Month Cost Calculation**:
- Pay-as-you-go: 1,000,000 ÷ 1,000 × $1.50 = **$1,500/month**
- Growth tier: 1,000,000 ÷ 1,000 × $0.95 = **$950/month** (plus $499 minimum = meets minimum)
- Business tier: 1,000,000 ÷ 1,000 × $0.84 = **$840/month** (requires $999 minimum subscription)
- Premium tier: 1,000,000 ÷ 1,000 × $0.79 = **$790/month** (requires $1,999 minimum subscription)

**Assumptions**: 
- Prices reflect 25% discount with code APIS25 (valid as of retrieval date)
