### Provider Research Prompt — Bright Data (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` (in this folder) covering Bright Data for X/Twitter content access.

Include all sections per shared context, with dated citations. Emphasize pricing units (per request/GB/IP), rate limits, latency (vendor‑claimed), SLA, and compliance posture.

Tooling: Tavily, Context7 (SDKs if any), GitHub MCP, generic web search.

Suggested queries:
- "site:brightdata.com pricing"
- "site:brightdata.com docs twitter OR x.com"
- "Bright Data Web Unlocker Twitter"
- "Bright Data SLA uptime"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References and retrieval dates.
