### Framework Task Prompt — Compliance Notes (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only.

Goal: Produce `report.md` that summarizes ToS constraints for X.com, when the official API may be required, GDPR/CCPA/DSA considerations, jurisdictional notes, retention limits, and mitigations (public‑data‑only, consent‑based collection).
