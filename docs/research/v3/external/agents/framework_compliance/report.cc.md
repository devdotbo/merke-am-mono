# Compliance Framework for X/Twitter Data Collection Methods

*Research Date: 2025-01-24*

## Executive Summary

- X/Twitter's Terms of Service explicitly prohibit automated data collection without API access, requiring official API usage for systematic data extraction
- GDPR Article 6 requires a lawful basis for processing publicly available data, with legitimate interest requiring careful balancing tests
- Recent court rulings (Meta v. Bright Data 2024, Van Buren v. US 2021) have narrowed the scope of computer fraud claims but haven't eliminated ToS-based contractual obligations
- CCPA/CPRA introduces new requirements for Automated Decision-Making Technology (ADMT) starting in 2027, with opt-out rights for significant decisions
- Digital Services Act (DSA) imposes content moderation and transparency obligations on platforms, affecting data collection practices

## Research Methodology

This analysis synthesizes information from multiple sources including legal precedents, regulatory frameworks, industry reports, and platform policies. Sources were accessed via web search and document analysis on 2025-01-24. All interpretations of legal requirements are marked clearly and should be verified with legal counsel for specific use cases.

## Key Findings

### 1. X/Twitter Terms of Service and API Requirements

#### Platform Policies
Based on research conducted on 2025-01-24, X (formerly Twitter) maintains strict policies regarding automated data collection:

- **Automated Access Prohibition**: The platform's Terms of Service prohibit automated scraping, crawling, or systematic data collection without explicit authorization
- **API-First Approach**: X requires developers to use official APIs for programmatic access to platform data
- **Enforcement Actions**: The platform actively pursues legal action against unauthorized scrapers, as evidenced by ongoing litigation with data aggregation companies

#### API Pricing Structure (as of 2025)
X's API access has undergone significant changes:

- **Free Tier**: Severely limited, with recent removal of like and follow capabilities (August 2025)
- **Basic Tier**: $100/month with strict rate limits (100 automated posts per 24 hours)
- **Pro and Enterprise Tiers**: Higher-cost options with expanded access and capabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: All tiers subject to strict rate limits to prevent abuse

### 2. GDPR Compliance Requirements

#### Article 6 Lawful Basis for Processing
Under GDPR, processing publicly available personal data still requires a lawful basis:

**Available Legal Bases:**
1. **Consent** (Article 6(1)(a)): Difficult to obtain for public social media data
2. **Legitimate Interest** (Article 6(1)(f)): Most commonly relied upon for public data
3. **Legal Obligation** (Article 6(1)(c)): When required by law
4. **Vital Interests** (Article 6(1)(d)): Rarely applicable
5. **Public Task** (Article 6(1)(e)): For public authorities
6. **Contract** (Article 6(1)(b)): When necessary for contract performance

**Legitimate Interest Assessment Requirements:**
- Purpose Test: Identify clear, specific legitimate interest
- Necessity Test: Demonstrate data processing is necessary
- Balancing Test: Weigh interests against data subject rights
- Documentation: Maintain records of assessment

#### Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation
- Collect only data necessary for specified purposes
- Cannot repurpose data without new legal basis
- Must implement data retention limits

#### Transparency Obligations
- Provide clear privacy notices (Article 13/14 GDPR)
- Inform data subjects about processing activities
- Challenge: Notifying users when collecting public data

## Data Retention Requirements

### GDPR Requirements
- **Storage Limitation Principle**: Data kept only as long as necessary
- **Retention Policy Requirements**:
  - Define clear retention periods
