### Provider Research Prompt — Smartproxy (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` covering Smartproxy’s options for X/Twitter (proxies, Scraping APIs).

Include sections per shared context with dated citations. Emphasize pricing units, SLAs, and anti‑bot features.

Suggested queries:
- "site:smartproxy.com pricing"
- "site:smartproxy.com docs twitter OR x.com"
- "Smartproxy web scraper api twitter"
- "Smartproxy SLA uptime"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References.
