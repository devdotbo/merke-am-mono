## Analysis & Insights

**Strengths:**
- Competitive entry pricing at $0.08/1K requests
- Strong compliance framework with GDPR/CCPA
- Multiple SDK options for easy integration
- Established player since 2018

**Limitations:**
- **Critical: No clear X/Twitter support in Social Media Scraping API**
- Limited public documentation on API endpoints
- No detailed SLA commitments found
- Rate limits may be restrictive for high-volume scenarios

**Suitability for X/Twitter Access:**
Based on available evidence, Smartproxy appears to have **limited or no specific X/Twitter scraping capabilities** in their Social Media API product. While they offer general proxy services that could theoretically access X/Twitter, their scraping API seems focused on TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit. Organizations requiring X/Twitter data should verify current capabilities directly with Smartproxy or consider alternatives with documented X/Twitter support.

## Areas of Uncertainty

1. **X/Twitter Support:** No concrete documentation found confirming X/Twitter endpoints in Social Media Scraping API
2. **Actual API Endpoints:** Specific endpoint URLs and request structures not publicly documented
3. **SLA Details:** No formal SLA documentation located beyond uptime claims
4. **Enterprise Pricing:** Custom pricing not transparent for high-volume scenarios
5. **Data Freshness:** Real-time vs cached data not specified

## Recommendation

Smartproxy/Decodo may not be suitable for X/Twitter data collection based on current documentation. Their Social Media Scraping API appears to focus on other platforms. For X/Twitter access, consider:
1. Requesting direct confirmation from Smartproxy sales about X/Twitter capabilities
2. Evaluating competitors with documented X/Twitter support (Bright Data, Apify)
3. Using their general proxy infrastructure with custom scraping solution if X/Twitter access is critical
