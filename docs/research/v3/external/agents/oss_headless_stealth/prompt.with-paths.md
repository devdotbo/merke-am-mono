### Open‑Source Baseline Prompt — Playwright/Puppeteer + stealth (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` on headless browser + stealth approaches: capabilities for X/Twitter, setup, proxy needs, anti‑bot handling, throughput, reliability, and maintenance overhead.

Suggested queries:
- Playwright stealth guides, Puppeteer stealth plugins
- "twitter x.com scraping playwright puppeteer headless bypass"
- Proxy rotation best practices, CAPTCHA handling

Deliverable: `report.md` with References and retrieval dates.
