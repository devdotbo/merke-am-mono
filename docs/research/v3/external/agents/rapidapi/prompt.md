### Provider Research Prompt — RapidAPI Marketplace Samples (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Survey 2‑3 Twitter/X providers on RapidAPI; produce `report.md` with pricing, limits, latency (vendor‑claimed), and reliability signals.

Include sections per shared context; capture variability across marketplace sellers and any ToS considerations.

Suggested queries:
- "site:rapidapi.com twitter api pricing"
- "rapidapi twitter x.com search timeline threads"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References.
