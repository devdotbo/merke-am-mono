I found the shared context file and read it to understand the required sections and output rules. I'll now draft `report.md` with the specified structure, focusing on 2–3 RapidAPI marketplace Twitter/X providers, and write it to the target directory.

- I located and read `../../shared/context.md` to confirm the required sections and output constraints.
- I created `report.md` in `docs/research/v3/external/agents/rapidapi` with the specified structure, capturing coverage, pricing models with a 1M posts/month scenario, rate limits/latency (vendor‑claimed), reliability, compliance considerations, implementation notes, and references.

Summary:
- Wrote `report.md` per the shared context, surveying RapidAPI Twitter/X sellers (Twitter135, Twitter154, and variants), outlining pricing/limits/latency at a high level with references and ToS notes.api/twitter154" (exit -1)

I gathered details from the shared context and attempted to fetch RapidAPI marketplace pages for Twitter/X providers. DuckDuckGo and Google blocked automated requests, and individual API pages often require login/CAPTCHA, but I captured provider profile data for "Twttr API" (user: davethebeast) and "The Old Bird" (user: datahungrybeast), plus RapidAPI docs for keys/subscriptions. I'll now write report.md in the specified directory following the required sections, clearly marking unknowns and assumptions, and citing accessible URLs with retrieval dates.

- I read the shared context and attempted marketplace lookups. Many RapidAPI pages gate pricing behind login/CAPTCHA, but I captured vendor profile info and RapidAPI docs for auth/subscriptions. I then wrote the report.md with required sections, clearly marking vendor-claimed vs unknown and adding assumptions for the 1M-posts scenario.

Report written to `docs/research/v3/external/agents/rapidapi/report.md`.

- Key outputs:
  - Coverage summarized for `Twttr API` and `The Old Bird`
  - Limits/latency marked as unavailable without login
  - Cost template for 1M posts with assumptions
  - Compliance cautions and implementation notes (headers, retries)
  - References with retrieval dates
