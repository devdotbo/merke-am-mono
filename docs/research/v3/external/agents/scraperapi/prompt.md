### Provider Research Prompt — ScraperAPI (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` covering ScraperAPI for X/Twitter scraping/use.

Include sections per shared context. Focus on pricing units (per request vs concurrency), rate limits, latency (vendor‑claimed), and compliance.

Suggested queries:
- "site:scraperapi.com pricing"
- "site:scraperapi.com docs twitter OR x.com"
- "ScraperAPI twitter scraper guide"
- "ScraperAPI SLA uptime"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References.
