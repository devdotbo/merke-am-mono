### Executive summary and recommendation stance
- ScraperAPI is a general-purpose web scraping API that can be used against X/Twitter via its HTTP API, proxy port, or async mode. It provides IP rotation, CAPTCHA handling, optional JS rendering, and structured data endpoints. Vendor materials do not provide X-specific endpoints.
- For X-scale programs, use async mode and conservative timeouts; expect variable success rates due to X’s anti-bot controls. Pricing is credit-based per request; concurrency appears plan‑based but is not numerically documented publicly. Proceed if you need a flexible, vendor-managed proxy + rendering layer and can operate within website ToS; otherwise consider X’s official API for compliant access.

### Coverage & features for X/Twitter
- General scraping, not an X‑specific API. Supports:
  - HTTP API endpoint (`api.scraperapi.com`) with query params, including `render=true` for JS rendering and geotargeting via `country_code` (vendor docs).
  - Proxy port access and an async scraping service for high-volume workloads (vendor docs).
  - Structured Data service endpoint (vendor docs). 
- No official X/Twitter extractor schemas or endpoints are published by the vendor; you’ll implement URL construction, pagination, and parsing yourself.

### Rate limits and latency
- Vendor recommends setting a 70s application timeout to maximize success on hard domains (vendor-claimed). Treat this as guidance, not a latency SLO.
- No explicit per-account request-per-second (RPS) or concurrency caps are published in docs. Concurrency limits appear to be plan-based on the pricing page, but figures are not exposed publicly.

### Pricing model and tiers with a 1M posts/month scenario
- Model: API credits per request (vendor terminology: “API credits”); free trial advertises 5,000 free API credits (vendor-claimed). Public pages do not list numeric prices per tier at time of retrieval.
- Assumptions for planning:
  - Unit: 1 credit ≈ 1 request to target (your code may issue multiple requests per post, e.g., pagination/expansions/media).
  - Concurrency: governed by plan; unknown numeric limits; expect to size plan to meet throughput.
- 1M posts/month scenario (formulaic, because price not public):
  - Let P = price per 1,000 requests (USD). Total requests R = posts × requests_per_post.
  - Example planning formula: monthly_cost = (R / 1,000) × P.
  - If requests_per_post averages 1.5 (pagination/details), R = 1,500,000. Plug your negotiated P to estimate cost.

### Reliability & SLA
- Public status page shows current system state and historical incidents. No formal SLA or uptime percentage is stated on public pages reviewed. Treat reliability as best‑effort with incident transparency via status page.

### Compliance posture (ToS alignment, anti‑abuse, data handling)
- Terms of Use apply; users are responsible for lawful use and compliance with applicable website terms and regulations. No X‑specific legal guidance is provided by vendor materials.
- You must assess X.com Terms, local laws (GDPR/CCPA/DSA), and your purpose (e.g., research vs. commercial) before scraping. For compliant and stable access, prefer X’s official API when feasible.

### Implementation notes (auth, pagination, retries/backoff, sample requests/SDK refs)
- Auth: API key via query param `api_key=...` (or proxy auth). 
- Entry points:
  - API endpoint: `http://api.scraperapi.com?api_key=APIKEY&url=ENCODED_URL`
  - Enable JS rendering: add `render=true`
  - Geotargeting: `country_code=us` (example)
  - Async service: `http://async.scraperapi.com` (for high volume)
  - Proxy port: `http://scraperapi:APIKEY@proxy-server.scraperapi.com:8001`
  - Structured data: `https://api.scraperapi.com/structured/`
- Retries/backoff: implement idempotent retries with exponential backoff and jitter. Respect target-site robots and ToS.
- Timeouts: vendor recommends 70s client timeout for difficult domains.
- Pagination (X/Twitter): construct and iterate URL parameters (e.g., query cursors) as discovered; handle 429/403 with adaptive backoff and rotate parameters/headers.
