I’ll open the shared context file to extract constraints and required terminology, then draft and write `report.md` in the methodology directory.

I found the shared context file. I’ll draft the methodology and write report.md into the `framework_methodology` directory now.

- I located and read `docs/research/v3/external/shared/context.md`. Now I’ve authored `report.md` with methodology, acceptance criteria, quality checks, citation standards, a tools-first process, validation rules, and a cost scenario template, tailored to the shared context.

- Key inclusions:
  - Tools-first workflow; external-only constraints reflected.
  - Explicit [Vendor‑claimed] vs [Verified] labeling and recency rules.
  - Acceptance criteria and quality checks covering sections, evidence, math, and compliance.
  - Cost scenario template plus a worked example for 1M posts/month.
  - Reporting standards for both provider and OSS reports, with formatting and references guidance.
