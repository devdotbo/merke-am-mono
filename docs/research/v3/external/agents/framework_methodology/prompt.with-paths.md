### Framework Task Prompt — Methodology (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only.

Goal: Produce `report.md` that codifies methodology, acceptance criteria, quality checks, and reporting standards for all provider/OSS reports.

Include: tools‑first process, citation standards, cost scenario template, and validation rules (vendor‑claimed vs verified).
