I'll read `../../shared/context.md` to tailor the weights, then I'll write `report.md` with a normalized vector and rationale.

I read the shared context. I'll now write `report.md` in the `framework_weights` directory with a concise rationale and a normalized weight vector.
Wrote /home/user/git/2025_2/wavehack/merke-am/merke-am-landing/docs/research/v3/external/agents/framework_weights/report.md
- Wrote `framework_weights/report.md` with concise rationale and a normalized weight vector tailored to the external-only scope.

- Weights (coverage, cost, reliability, latency, compliance, engineering effort, maintenance):
``` 
[0.28, 0.14, 0.18, 0.04, 0.20, 0.06, 0.10]
