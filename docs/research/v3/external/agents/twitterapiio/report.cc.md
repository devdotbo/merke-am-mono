| ≥ 50,000                 | 20        |

**Performance Metrics [Vendor-claimed]:**
- Response time: 800ms average (Retrieved 2025-01-24)
- Default throughput: 1000+ QPS potential mentioned in marketing materials
- Global CDN infrastructure claimed for low latency
- Real-time data with "sub-second latency from Twitter's firehose" [Vendor-claimed]

**Quotas:**
- No explicit monthly quotas mentioned
- Pure pay-per-use model without subscription tiers
- Minimum charge: $0.00015 (15 Credits) per API call

### Pricing Model and Tiers

#### Credit-Based Pricing System
From official pricing page (Retrieved 2025-01-24):

| Service | Cost per 1,000 units | Credits per unit |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Tweets | $0.15 | 15 |
| Profiles | $0.18 | 18 |
| Followers | $0.15 | 15 |

**Conversion:** 1 USD = 100,000 Credits

**Credit System Features:**
- Recharged credits never expire
- Bonus credits included with recharges (valid 30 days)
- Higher recharge amounts receive up to 5% discount
- Minimum charge per API call: 15 credits (waived for bulk responses)

#### 1M Posts/Month Scenario Calculation

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000,000 tweets retrieved per month
- Using tweet search/retrieval endpoints

**Cost Calculation:**
- 1,000,000 tweets ÷ 1,000 = 1,000 units
- 1,000 units × $0.15 = **$150 per month**

**Comparison:**
- Official Twitter API Basic tier: $200/month for 10,000 posts only
- Official Twitter API Enterprise: $42,000+/month
- TwitterAPI.io savings: 96.4% compared to Enterprise tier

### Reliability & SLA

#### Uptime and Service Status
From status page (Retrieved 2025-01-24):

**[Vendor-claimed] Metrics:**
- 99.9% uptime (30 days)
- 245ms average response time
- 99.99% uptime SLA mentioned in marketing materials

**Service Monitoring:**
- Real-time status page available
- Components monitored: API endpoints, Dashboard, Documentation, Webhook Delivery
- Recent incident: Twitter service impact noted on May 24, 2025 (upstream issues)
- Email and RSS feed notifications for service updates

**No formal SLA document found** - uptime guarantees appear to be marketing claims without contractual backing.

### Compliance Posture

#### Critical Legal Gaps

**Major Issue: No Terms of Service**
Independent analysis from Qiita (Retrieved 2025-01-24) confirms:
- Complete absence of Terms of Service document
- No `/terms` endpoint or page exists
- Legal responsibilities and liabilities undefined
- No dispute resolution framework

#### Privacy Policy (Retrieved 2025-01-24)

**Data Handling:**
- 48-hour maximum data retention
- AWS storage with ISO 27001 compliance
- End-to-end encryption claimed
- No third-party data sharing
- Google OAuth data handled per Google's User Data Policy

**Compliance Concerns:**
- Service explicitly states "unaffiliated with X Corp. (Twitter)"
- No mention of compliance with Twitter's Terms of Service
- Unclear legal standing for reselling Twitter data
- Risk of account suspension acknowledged in blog posts

#### Creator Information
Based on third-party research (Retrieved 2025-01-24):
- Created by individual developer (M. Kaito, ~20 years old)
- Based in Sendai, Japan
- Operating as personal business, not incorporated entity
- Technical competence noted but legal framework lacking

### Implementation Notes

#### Authentication
- Simple API key authentication via `x-api-key` header
- No OAuth complexity required

params = {
    "query": "search terms",
    "queryType": "Latest"
}

response = requests.get(base_url, headers=headers, params=params)
```

#### Pagination
- Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- `next_cursor` field in responses
- `has_next_page` boolean indicator
- Max_id parameter for historical data beyond 800-1200 tweet limit

#### Rate Limiting & Retry Strategy
From code examples:
- 429 status code for rate limit exceeded
- Recommended exponential backoff: `time.sleep(2 ** retry_count)`
- Free trial users: 1 request per 5 seconds limit
- Paid users: Based on account balance tiers

### Recommendation
While TwitterAPI.io offers compelling pricing and features, the complete absence of Terms of Service and single-developer operation present unacceptable risks for production enterprise use. The service may be suitable for personal projects or proof-of-concepts, but organizations should wait for proper legal framework establishment before considering production deployment.
