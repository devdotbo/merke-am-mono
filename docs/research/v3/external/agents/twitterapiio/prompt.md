### Provider Research Prompt — TwitterAPI.io (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` covering TwitterAPI.io’s coverage, limits, pricing, and reliability.

Include sections per shared context; emphasize endpoint coverage (search, timelines, threads), quotas, response latency (vendor‑claimed), and SLAs.

Suggested queries:
- "site:twitterapi.io pricing"
- "site:twitterapi.io docs"
- "TwitterAPI.io rate limits latency"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References.
