I'll open the shared context file to extract constraints and any pricing guidance, then draft and write `report.md` with explicit assumptions, scenarios, retries/backoff, success rates, and sensitivity ranges.

I'll write `report.md` with explicit assumptions, formulas, retries/backoff logic, and low/base/high 1M-post scenarios including sensitivity notes.

- I read `../../shared/context.md` and extracted the required sections and constraints.
- I created `report.md` in your working directory with explicit assumptions, formulas, retries/backoff, and three 1M-post scenarios plus sensitivity notes.

- Key outputs:
  - Cost equations with units.
  - Low/Base/High scenarios with p0, retries, attempt math, and totals.
  - Retry/backoff pseudocode and implementation notes.
  - References section indicating that unit prices are placeholders to be replaced with cited vendor pricing.
