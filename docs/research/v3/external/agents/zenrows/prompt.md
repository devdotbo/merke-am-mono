### Provider Research Prompt — ZenRows (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` (in this folder) covering ZenRows for X/Twitter content access.

Include all sections per shared context with dated citations. Emphasize pricing units, anti‑bot/JS rendering, and any Twitter‑specific guides.

Suggested queries:
- "site:zenrows.com pricing"
- "site:zenrows.com docs twitter OR x.com"
- "ZenRows API twitter scraper"
- "ZenRows headless browser pricing"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References.
