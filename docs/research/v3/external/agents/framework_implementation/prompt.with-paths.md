### Framework Task Prompt — Implementation Notes & Pseudocode (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only.

Goal: Produce `report.md` with implementation notes: auth flows, pagination patterns, retries/backoff, caching, observability. Include pseudocode for Apify actor run lifecycle, Bright Data proxy usage, and a generic retry with exponential backoff.
