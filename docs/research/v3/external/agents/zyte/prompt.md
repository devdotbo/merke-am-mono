### Provider Research Prompt — Zyte (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` covering Zyte's options for X/Twitter (Zyte API, Smart Proxy Manager, Browser).

Include sections per shared context with dated citations. Note pricing units and any Twitter‑specific guidance or restrictions.

Suggested queries:
- "site:zyte.com pricing"
- "site:docs.zyte.com twitter OR x.com"
- "Zyte Smart Proxy Manager Twitter"
- "Zyte API rate limits"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References.
