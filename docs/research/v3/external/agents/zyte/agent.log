I created `report.md` in `docs/research/v3/external/agents/zyte`, following the shared context structure. I verified the content and included dated references per the rules.

- Added sections covering Zyte API, Smart Proxy Manager, and Browser/Playwright integration for X/Twitter.
- Noted vendor-claimed rate/throughput language, absence of explicit public rate limits, and Twitter-specific compliance considerations.
- Included a 1M posts/month cost scenario with clearly labeled assumptions and pricing unit notes, pointing to Zyte pricing/docs for actual rates.
- Implementation notes cover auth, pagination/scrolling, retries/backoff, sample Zyte API usage, and SDK references.
- References list the official Zyte pricing, docs, and legal pages with retrieval date 2025‑08‑24.
