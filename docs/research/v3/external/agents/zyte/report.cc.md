from zyte_api import AsyncZyteAPI

async def main():
    client = AsyncZyteAPI()  # Uses API key from environment
    api_response = await client.get({
        "url": "https://example.com",
        "browserHtml": True,
    })
    return api_response["browserHtml"]

asyncio.run(main())
```

```python
# Using requests library
import requests
from base64 import b64decode

api_response = requests.post(
    "https://api.zyte.com/v1/extract",
    auth=("YOUR_ZYTE_API_KEY", ""),  # API key as username, no password
    json={
        "url": "https://example.com",
        "httpResponseBody": True,
    },
)
```

### 7. Twitter-Specific Guidance

**Critical Finding**: No Twitter/X.com-specific documentation, examples, or pricing found in Zyte's public materials. The platform appears to offer general social media scraping capabilities through:

- socialMediaPost extraction type
- Browser automation for JavaScript-heavy sites
- Anti-detection and proxy management

However, successful Twitter/X.com scraping faces significant challenges:
- Platform has updated ToS with strict data access restrictions
- Authentication required for most data points
- No vendor-provided Twitter-specific implementation guidance

## Areas of Uncertainty

1. **Twitter/X.com Support**: No explicit confirmation of Twitter/X.com compatibility or success rates
2. **Specific Pricing**: Actual costs for Twitter/X scraping unclear without using cost calculator
3. **Rate Limits**: No Twitter-specific rate limit information available
4. **Uptime SLA**: No specific uptime percentage guarantees found in public documentation
5. **Data Coverage**: Unclear which Twitter/X features (timeline, search, media) are accessible

## Analysis & Insights

Zyte API presents a robust general-purpose web scraping solution with strong performance metrics and comprehensive features. However, for Twitter/X.com specifically:

**Strengths**:
- Proven browser automation and JavaScript rendering capabilities
- Strong anti-detection technology with high success rates
- Flexible pricing model that adjusts to website complexity
- Enterprise-grade compliance support

**Weaknesses**:
- No Twitter/X-specific documentation or examples
- Pricing can escalate significantly with browser automation
- No explicit uptime SLA percentages
- Learning curve for optimization

**Recommendation**: While Zyte API has the technical capabilities for social media scraping, the lack of Twitter/X-specific documentation and the platform's strict data access policies suggest careful evaluation is needed. Consider requesting a proof-of-concept or trial specifically for Twitter/X.com before committing to volume purchases.
