### 3. Pricing Model and Tiers

#### Pay-As-You-Go Structure
- **Free Tier**: First 1,000 requests free [Vendor-claimed]

## Appendix

### Recommendation
**Not Recommended for Twitter/X Use Case**

Crawlbase appears to be a capable general-purpose web scraping service but lacks the specialized features, documentation, and proven track record needed for reliable Twitter/X content extraction. Organizations requiring Twitter/X data access should consider:

1. **Specialized alternatives** with dedicated Twitter/X support
2. **Official Twitter API** v2 for compliant access (if requirements fit within limits)
3. **Purpose-built social media scraping services** with proven Twitter capabilities

### Key Takeaway
While Crawlbase offers competitive general web scraping capabilities, it is not positioned or equipped as a Twitter/X scraping solution. The absence of Twitter-specific features, documentation, and compliance guidance makes it unsuitable for production Twitter/X data extraction needs.
