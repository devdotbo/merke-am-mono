### Provider Research Prompt — Crawlbase (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` covering Crawlbase (formerly ProxyCrawl) for X/Twitter content access.

Include sections per shared context. Note pricing units, rate limits, JS rendering/anti‑bot, and compliance posture.

Suggested queries:
- "site:crawlbase.com pricing"
- "site:crawlbase.com docs twitter OR x.com"
- "Crawlbase scraper api twitter"
- "ProxyCrawl twitter guide"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References.
