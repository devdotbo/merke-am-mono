### Provider Research Prompt — Scrapingdog (External‑Only)

Read: `../../shared/context.md` only. Do not read other agents.

Goal: Produce `report.md` covering Scrapingdog for X/Twitter access.

Include sections per shared context with dated citations. Focus on pricing, rate limits, and any Twitter‑specific docs.

Suggested queries:
- "site:scrapingdog.com pricing"
- "site:scrapingdog.com blog twitter OR x.com"
- "Scrapingdog api twitter"

Deliverable: `report.md` with References.
