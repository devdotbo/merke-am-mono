Practical takeaways:
- For managed providers (Bright Data, Zyte, Oxylabs), user feedback emphasizes reliability and support, with premium pricing. Validate ROI vs. needs.
- Value‑oriented APIs (Apify, ScraperAPI, Smartproxy, Crawlbase, ZenRows) receive positive notes on ease and cost; watch for pricing model nuances and feature‑based limits.
- Marketplaces (RapidAPI) show elevated risk for payouts/support; prefer direct vendor relationships when possible.
- OSS (twscrape/snscrape) can work but are brittle against X changes; plan for auth, proxies, and frequent breakage.
