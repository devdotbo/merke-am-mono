### Overview
Latenode is a hosted low/no‑code automation builder that combines visual blocks with inline JavaScript, aimed at API‑centric workflows and lightweight backends. It focuses on fast iteration with an AI copilot and simple deployment.

### Embedding model
No first‑class, white‑label embeddable editor. Light embedding is possible via authenticated iframe/deep links to the cloud UI; programmatic invocation via webhooks/API.

### Licensing
Proprietary SaaS (free and paid tiers). No self‑host at time of writing.

### Execution engine
Runs in Latenode’s cloud. Supports webhooks and schedules, step logs, retries, and code nodes that execute server‑side JavaScript.

### Connectors
HTTP, webhooks, and popular SaaS/databases (smaller catalog than Zapier/Make). Extend via code node and REST.

### Embedding friction
Medium–high: no SDK for multi‑tenant in‑app builder; identity and secrets live in Latenode.

### Pros
- Fast to prototype; JavaScript‑first flexibility
- AI‑assisted node creation
- Reasonable cost for small teams

### Cons
- No self‑hosting/air‑gap
- Limited white‑label embedding
- Smaller connector catalog; enterprise RBAC/audit limited

### POC steps
1) Create account and a three‑step flow: Webhook → HTTP Request → Transform (JS).
2) Exercise retries and logs; validate schedule trigger.
3) Call the webhook from your app; verify headers/secrets management.
4) Test iframe/deep‑link embed viability.

### Recommendation
Use when you need a quick, cloud‑hosted automation layer and can keep users inside Latenode’s UI. Not recommended if you require an embeddable, white‑label builder or self‑hosted execution.

### Embedding checklist
1) Confirm webhook/API surface for external triggers; create per‑tenant endpoints.
2) Evaluate iframe/deep‑link approach with SSO and CSP headers.
3) Define secrets ownership (in Latenode) and rotation policies.
4) Capture run logs via API; forward to your analytics/observability.
5) Validate retries, schedules, and limits under load; test cold‑start.

### Fit signals
- Need fast prototyping with JS code nodes and minimal ops.
- Hosted execution is acceptable; editor living outside your app is fine.

### Risks / open questions
- White‑label/embed limitations; UX parity not achievable.
- Catalog breadth vs incumbents; custom API coverage via code node.
- Data residency/compliance for enterprise customers.
