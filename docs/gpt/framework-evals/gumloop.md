### Overview
Gumloop is an AI‑first workflow builder for automating web and data tasks using LLMs plus actions (browse, extract, call APIs).

### Embedding model
No published white‑label editor SDK. Sharing via public links/embeds may be possible; deeper integration via API/webhooks.

### Licensing
Proprietary SaaS with usage‑based pricing (runs/compute).

### Execution engine
Cloud‑hosted. Orchestrates LLM prompts with headless web actions and API calls; supports schedules and webhooks; run logs available.

### Connectors
Focused on web automation, files, and common SaaS; catalog smaller than general automation platforms. Extend via HTTP and custom prompts/code (where supported).

### Embedding friction
Medium: lack of embeddable canvas; identity/secrets live in Gumloop; cross‑origin/iframe constraints for any share‑embed.

### Pros
- Rapid AI agent/workflow creation
- Built‑in web browsing/extraction
- Good for document/web RPA‑style tasks

### Cons
- Earlier‑stage maturity vs incumbents
- Limited connector breadth; observability/debugging can be coarse
- No self‑host; unclear enterprise RBAC/audit

### POC steps
1) Build a demo flow: Webhook → Browse webpage → Extract → HTTP POST.
2) Validate schedule trigger and run logs.
3) Test API/webhook invocation from your app.
4) Trial any share/embed link in a sandbox page.

### Recommendation
Consider for AI/RPA‑like automations where web interaction is central. Not recommended if you need a general‑purpose, embeddable workflow editor or strict data residency.
