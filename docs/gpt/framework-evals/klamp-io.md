### Overview
Klamp.io is positioned as an embedded iPaaS: a hosted, drag‑and‑drop workflow builder and execution platform you can embed into your product to offer native integrations without building an engine from scratch.

### Embedding model
- Embed via iframe or JS components backed by REST APIs and webhooks.
- Vendor‑hosted multi‑tenant control plane; connect your auth using tokens/SSO.
- White‑label branding; manage secrets/connections per workspace/account.

### Licensing
- Commercial SaaS (not OSS). Pricing typically usage/plan‑based; confirm enterprise terms (SLAs, data residency, SSO, audit).

### Execution engine
- Cloud execution of flows with triggers (webhooks/schedules) and actions.
- Step retries, timeouts, error handling, and run logs; per‑step inputs/outputs.
- Queue‑based scaling managed by vendor; observability via dashboards and APIs.

### Connectors/integrations
- Catalog of common SaaS connectors (HTTP, CRM, messaging, files, sheets, email, etc.).
- Generic HTTP and custom connector tooling/SDK for gaps; OAuth and API key auth.

### Embedding friction
- SSO/session brokering and cross‑domain embedding add setup complexity.
- Theming/UX are customizable but constrained vs fully in‑app React builders.
- Vendor hosting implies data‑residency and tenancy reviews; on‑prem/self‑host usually not available.

### Pros
- Fast time‑to‑market for an in‑app integrations catalog.
- Hosted execution, scaling, logs, and retries out of the box.
- Connector catalog plus custom connector SDK.
- White‑label embed with workspace‑scoped secrets and connections.

### Cons
- Vendor lock‑in; limited deep UX customization beyond provided components.
- No OSS/self‑host path; compliance/data residency must align with your needs.
- Pricing can scale with runs/connectors; careful cost modeling required.

### POC steps
1) Provision sandbox tenant; enable SSO/token exchange for your app.
2) Build: Webhook → HTTP Request → Transform → Slack (or CRM) demo flow.
3) Embed builder in a test route; configure cross‑domain and branding.
4) Validate logs, retries, secrets isolation, and export/import.
5) Implement one custom connector to a niche API.

### Recommendation
If you need an embedded integrations marketplace quickly and can accept a hosted control plane, Klamp.io is a pragmatic choice. If you require deep in‑app UX control or self‑hosting, prefer the React Flow “build‑your‑own” path or a self‑hosted platform like Activepieces.

### Embedding checklist
1) Establish SSO/token exchange for cross‑domain embed; short‑lived tokens and refresh.
2) Map your tenants→Klamp workspaces; scope secrets/connections accordingly.
3) Curate connector catalog; pre‑configure OAuth apps and redirect URIs per environment.
4) Configure webhooks and callback endpoints behind your gateway with allowlists.
5) Implement audit export: runs, edits, credentials changes to your SIEM.
6) Define incident processes for failed runs, rate limits, and provider outages.

### Fit signals
- You want a vendor‑hosted embedded iPaaS with a broad connector set.
- Your team prefers buying execution/logging/retries rather than building.

### Risks / open questions
- Data residency, on‑prem options, and SLAs required by your customers.
- Depth of white‑label theming and component API surface.
- Pricing at scale (runs/connectors) and overage management.
