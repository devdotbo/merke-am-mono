# Node-RED Evaluation

## Executive Summary
Node-RED is an open-source, browser-based visual workflow tool originally developed by IBM and now maintained by the OpenJS Foundation. Built on Node.js with a flow-based programming environment, it offers extensive integration capabilities with over 2700 community nodes. While mature and feature-rich for IoT and automation use cases, it presents significant architectural challenges for embedding in modern collaborative web applications due to its monolithic design and lack of native multi-user support.

## Framework Overview
### Type
- [x] Workflow Builder
- [x] Flow-based Programming
- [x] Integration Platform
- [ ] State Management
- [ ] BPM/BPMN
- [ ] Other: _______

### Core Features
- **Primary purpose:** Visual workflow automation and IoT device orchestration
- **Target audience:** IoT developers, system integrators, and automation engineers
- **Key differentiators:** Extensive protocol support (MQTT, CoAP, Modbus), 2700+ community nodes, browser-based visual editor
- **License and pricing model:** Apache-2.0 (core), varied licenses for community nodes, completely free and self-hostable

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
- **Server component:** Node.js runtime (minimum v14) with Express server
- **Browser editor:** jQuery and D3.js-based visual interface with SVG canvas
- **Flow runtime:** Separate from editor, executes flows in Node.js process
- **Storage layer:** JSON documents with file-based or database storage options
- **Message system:** JavaScript objects passed between nodes via event-driven architecture

### State Management
- **State persistence mechanism:** JSON flow documents stored in files or databases
- **Real-time synchronization capabilities:** WebSocket connection for editor updates, but no multi-user conflict resolution
- **Undo/redo support:** Basic editor undo/redo functionality
- **Collaboration features:** None - designed for single-user editing with file-based locking

### Performance Metrics
- **Rendering performance:** Degrades with 100+ nodes, canvas rendering bottlenecks
- **Execution speed:** Good for I/O bound tasks, limited by Node.js single-thread for CPU intensive work
- **Memory footprint:** 100-500MB typical server footprint
- **Scalability characteristics:** Horizontal scaling requires multiple runtime instances

## Embedding Model

### Integration Method
- [ ] NPM Package

- [ ] Other: _______

### Embedding Checklist
- [ ] White-label support (limited theming via CSS overrides)
- [x] Custom theming/branding (basic color schemes and icon replacement)
- [x] Authentication integration (adminAuth and httpNodeAuth support)
- [ ] Permission management (basic RBAC, limited granularity)
- [ ] Data isolation (requires separate runtime instances for true isolation)
- [x] Event system for parent app communication (WebSocket and REST APIs)
- [ ] Customizable UI components (fixed layout structure, hardcoded components)
- [ ] Headless mode available (editor is tightly coupled to runtime)

## Execution Engine

### Execution Model
- [ ] Client-side only
- [x] Server-side only
- [ ] Hybrid (client + server)

- **CI/CD compatibility:** Git integration via Projects feature, manual deployment processes

## Implementation Analysis

### Code Patterns
- **Flow-based programming:** Nodes connected by wires passing message objects
- **Event-driven architecture:** Asynchronous message handling between nodes
- **Plugin system:** npm-based node distribution with HTML/JavaScript development
- **Context management:** Shared state via context stores (node, flow, global scopes)

### Integration Points
- **Authentication methods:** adminAuth (editor access), httpNodeAuth (runtime access), OAuth support
- **Data flow patterns:** Message objects with payload, topic, and metadata properties
- **Event handling:** Node-to-node message passing, catch/status error handling
- **API structure:** RESTful API for flow management, WebSocket for real-time updates

### Customization Options
- **UI customization depth:** Limited to CSS overrides, theme colors, and icon replacement
- **Business logic extension points:** Custom node development, Function nodes with JavaScript
- **Workflow constraints configuration:** Palette filtering, node restrictions via settings

## Pros and Cons
