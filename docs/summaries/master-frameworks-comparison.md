# Master Workflow Frameworks Comparison

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive comparison consolidates evaluations of workflow frameworks across multiple analysis tracks to provide definitive guidance for building embeddable automation platforms. The analysis covers 25+ frameworks spanning visual builders, code-first engines, JavaScript libraries, and integration platforms, evaluated against criteria including embeddability, execution capabilities, developer experience, and production readiness.

### Key Findings

- **Visual Node Editors**: React Flow emerges as the clear leader for custom embedded builders with excellent React integration and collaboration support
- **Self-Hosted Platforms**: Activepieces provides the best balance of modern architecture, extensive connectors, and embedding capabilities  
- **Hosted Solutions**: Zapier and Make offer the largest connector catalogs but with limited embedding options
