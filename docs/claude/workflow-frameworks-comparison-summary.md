# Workflow Frameworks Evaluation Summary

## Frameworks Analyzed

Six front-end relevant workflow frameworks from the n8n document were evaluated by parallel software-engineer agents:

| Framework | Score | Technology | Best For |
|-----------|-------|------------|----------|
| **React Flow** | 8.5/10 | React/TypeScript | Node-based UIs, visual workflows |
| **Activepieces** | 8.5/10 | TypeScript/React | Full automation platform |
| **Sequential Workflow Designer** | 8.0/10 | Pure TypeScript | Sequential workflows |
| **XState** | 7.5/10 | TypeScript | State management |
| **Automatisch** | 6.5/10 | JavaScript/React | Simple automations |
| **Node-RED** | 4.0/10 | Node.js | IoT/hardware (not suitable) |

## Top Recommendations

### 🏆 Winner: React Flow
**Why:** Native React integration, proven at scale (Stripe, Typeform), excellent TypeScript support, real-time collaboration ready.
- **Integration effort:** 4-6 weeks
- **Bundle size:** 80-100KB gzipped
- **Perfect for:** Your collaborative canvas needs

### 🥈 Runner-up: Activepieces (for full platform)
**Why:** Complete automation platform with AI features, excellent embedding options, MCP support.
- **Integration effort:** 6-8 weeks
- **Use case:** If you need full workflow automation beyond canvas

### 🥉 Specialized Choice: Sequential Workflow Designer
**Why:** Zero dependencies, lightweight, perfect for sequential processes.
- **Integration effort:** 4-6 weeks
- **Use case:** Multi-step forms, tutorials, linear workflows

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Next.js 15 Application          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  React Flow (Visual Canvas)         │
│  + XState (Complex State)           │
│  + Sequential WD (Linear Flows)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│     Convex (Real-time Sync)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phased Rollout
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** React Flow integration for canvas
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):** XState for complex interaction states
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6):** Sequential Workflow Designer for process flows
4. **Phase 4 (Optional):** Activepieces for external automations

## Key Insights

### What Works for Your Stack
- **React Flow** - Perfect fit for collaborative canvas with nodes
- **XState** - Ideal for managing complex UI states
- **Sequential WD** - Great for multi-step processes

### What Doesn't Work
- **Node-RED** - Architectural mismatch, separate server required
- **Automatisch** - No TypeScript, limited real-time features
- **Activepieces** - Overkill unless you need full automation platform

## Cost Analysis

| Framework | License | Cost | Hidden Costs |
|-----------|---------|------|--------------|
| React Flow | MIT | Free* | Pro features $149/month |
| Activepieces | MIT | Free | Hosting infrastructure |
| Sequential WD | MIT | Free | None |
| XState | MIT | Free | Learning curve time |
| Automatisch | AGPL | Free | Limited features |
| Node-RED | Apache 2.0 | Free | Separate infrastructure |

*React Flow Pro includes advanced features but base library is sufficient

## Final Recommendation

**For your collaborative canvas application:**

1. **Use React Flow** as the primary workflow/canvas library
2. **Add XState** for complex state management (canvas interactions, collaboration)
3. **Consider Sequential Workflow Designer** for linear process builders
4. **Skip** Node-RED and Automatisch (not suitable)
5. **Evaluate Activepieces** only if you need full automation platform features

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install recommended frameworks
npm install reactflow xstate @xstate/react
npm install sequential-workflow-designer sequential-workflow-model

# Optional: For automation platform
# Consider Activepieces as separate deployment
```
