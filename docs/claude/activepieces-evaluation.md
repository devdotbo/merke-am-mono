```

### Integration Patterns

**1. Iframe Embedding**
```typescript
// Initialize Activepieces SDK in Next.js
activepieces.configure({
  instanceUrl: process.env.ACTIVEPIECES_URL,
  jwtToken: generateJWT(user),
  containerId: 'workflow-builder',
  prefix: '/workflows',
  disableNavigation: true,
  hideLogo: true
});
```

**2. Webhook Integration with Convex**
```typescript
// Convex mutation triggered by Activepieces webhook
export const processWorkflow = mutation({
  args: { 
    event: v.object({...}),
    workflowId: v.string() 
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Process Activepieces event
    // Update canvas state
  }
});
```

**3. Custom Piece Development**
```typescript
// Custom piece for canvas operations
export const canvasAction = createAction({
  name: 'canvas-update',
  displayName: 'Update Canvas',
  props: {
    canvasId: Property.ShortText({...}),
    operation: Property.StaticDropdown({...})
  },
  async run(context) {
    // Execute canvas operation
  }
});
```

### Data Sync with Convex

**Real-time Synchronization:**
- Use Activepieces webhooks to trigger Convex mutations
- Implement bidirectional sync with polling triggers
- Queue-based processing for reliability

**Event Flow:**
1. Canvas action → Convex mutation → Activepieces webhook
2. Activepieces workflow → External API → Convex update
3. Scheduled task → Batch processing → Canvas refresh

### UI Embedding Options

**Option 1: Full Builder Embedding**
- Embed complete Activepieces builder
- White-label with custom branding
- JWT-based user authentication

**Option 2: Selective Component Integration**
- Use specific UI components
- Custom wrapper for workflow editor
- API-based flow management

**Option 3: Headless Integration**
- API-only integration
- Custom UI for workflow creation
- Activepieces as execution engine

### Custom Node Development

**Canvas-Specific Nodes:**
```typescript
// Example custom nodes for canvas
- Canvas Element Trigger
- Collaboration Event Action
- Asset Processing Action
- User Notification Action
- Data Sync Action
```

## Code Quality Assessment

### TypeScript Patterns
