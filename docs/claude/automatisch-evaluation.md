## Implementation Approach

### Integration with Next.js 15:

**Option 1: API Integration (Recommended)**
```javascript
// Connect via GraphQL API
const automatischAPI = {
  endpoint: 'http://automatisch-backend:3000/graphql',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ${token}' }
}

// Trigger workflows programmatically
// Fetch workflow status
// Manage connections
```

**Option 2: Iframe Embedding**
```javascript
// Simple iframe embed (limited interaction)
<iframe src="http://automatisch.local" />
```

**Option 3: Reverse Proxy**
```javascript
// Next.js API routes as proxy
// Maintains auth consistency
// Better security control
```

### Authentication Bridge:
- Implement SSO between your app and Automatisch
- Use JWT tokens for seamless auth
- Map user permissions appropriately

### Data Persistence with Convex:
- Use Automatisch PostgreSQL for workflow data
- Sync relevant data to Convex for your app
- Implement webhook listeners for workflow events

### UI Consistency:
- Override Automatisch CSS variables
- Implement custom theme matching your design system
- Consider building custom UI consuming GraphQL API

## Conclusion

Automatisch excels at its core mission: providing a simple, self-hosted alternative to Zapier. However, for a modern collaborative canvas application with Next.js 15 and Convex, its lack of TypeScript, limited real-time capabilities, and basic embedding options present significant challenges. 

While its simplicity philosophy is admirable and the codebase shows good practices, you may find yourself fighting against its limitations rather than benefiting from its strengths. Consider it for backend automation tasks but look elsewhere for your primary canvas workflow builder.
