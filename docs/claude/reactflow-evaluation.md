# React Flow Evaluation for Collaborative Canvas Application

## Framework Overview

React Flow (now part of the XyFlow ecosystem) is a highly customizable, MIT-licensed TypeScript library for building node-based user interfaces. It's designed for creating interactive diagrams, workflow builders, no-code applications, and data visualization tools. The library is used by major companies including Stripe, Typeform, and numerous Fortune 500 organizations.

**Installation:** `npm i reactflow`

**Core Purpose:** React Flow provides a powerful foundation for building interactive, node-based interfaces with built-in features for dragging, zooming, panning, and real-time collaboration. It treats nodes as React components, allowing developers to leverage existing web technologies directly on the canvas.

## Technical Analysis

### 1. Architecture & Design

**Component Structure:**
- Nodes are standard React components, allowing full customization
- Edge system with customizable connection lines
- Plugin architecture for extensions (MiniMap, Controls, Background)
- Event-driven architecture with comprehensive callback system

**TypeScript Support:**
- First-class TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- Full type safety for nodes, edges, and event handlers
- Generics support for custom node/edge data types

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Fast rendering with selective re-rendering (only changed nodes update)
- Efficient handling of large graphs (1500-2000 nodes per component)
- Virtual rendering support for massive datasets
- Optimized zoom/pan with d3-zoom integration

**Bundle Size Impact:**
- Base library: ~80-100KB gzipped
- Additional features can be tree-shaken
- Modular architecture allows importing only needed components
- Code-splitting friendly with dynamic imports

### 2. Integration Assessment

**Next.js 15 Compatibility:**
```typescript
// Example integration with Next.js 15 App Router
'use client';

import ReactFlow, {
  Controls,
  Background,
  applyNodeChanges,
  applyEdgeChanges,
  Node,
  Edge,
} from 'reactflow';
import 'reactflow/dist/style.css';

export default function WorkflowCanvas() {
  const [nodes, setNodes] = useState<Node[]>(initialNodes);
  const [edges, setEdges] = useState<Edge[]>(initialEdges);

  const onNodesChange = useCallback(
    (changes) => setNodes((nds) => applyNodeChanges(changes, nds)),
    []
  );

  return (
    <ReactFlow
      nodes={nodes}
      edges={edges}
      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
      fitView
    >
      <Controls />
      <Background />
    </ReactFlow>
  );
}
```

**Convex Real-time Backend Integration:**
```typescript
// Real-time synchronization with Convex
import { useQuery, useMutation } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "@/convex/_generated/api";

export function CollaborativeCanvas() {
  // Real-time node updates from Convex
  const nodes = useQuery(api.canvas.getNodes);
  const edges = useQuery(api.canvas.getEdges);
  const updateNode = useMutation(api.canvas.updateNode);

  const onNodesChange = useCallback(async (changes) => {
    // Sync changes to Convex for real-time collaboration
    for (const change of changes) {
      if (change.type === 'position') {
        await updateNode({
          id: change.id,
          position: change.position,
        });
      }
    }
  }, [updateNode]);

  return (
    <ReactFlow
      nodes={nodes || []}
      edges={edges || []}
      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
    />
  );
}
```

**State Management Options:**
- Built-in state management via ReactFlowProvider
- Compatible with Zustand (recommended by React Flow team)
- Works with Redux Toolkit, Jotai, or custom solutions
- Convex can serve as both state manager and persistence layer

**Tailwind CSS Compatibility:**
```typescript
// Custom node with Tailwind CSS
function CustomNode({ data }) {
  return (
    <div className="px-4 py-2 shadow-md rounded-md bg-white border-2 border-stone-400">
      <div className="flex items-center">
        <div className="rounded-full w-12 h-12 flex justify-center items-center bg-gray-100">
          <Icon className="w-6 h-6 text-gray-700" />
        </div>
        <div className="ml-2">
          <div className="text-lg font-bold">{data.label}</div>
          <div className="text-gray-500">{data.description}</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <Handle type="source" position={Position.Bottom} />
      <Handle type="target" position={Position.Top} />
    </div>
  );

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (Week 1)
```typescript
// 1. Install dependencies
npm i reactflow zustand

// 2. Create base canvas component
// app/components/canvas/FlowCanvas.tsx
import ReactFlow from 'reactflow';
import 'reactflow/dist/style.css';

// 3. Setup Convex schema
// convex/schema.ts
export default defineSchema({
  nodes: defineTable({
    flowId: v.string(),
    type: v.string(),
    position: v.object({ x: v.number(), y: v.number() }),
    data: v.any(),
  }),
  edges: defineTable({
    flowId: v.string(),
    source: v.string(),
    target: v.string(),
    type: v.optional(v.string()),
  }),
});
```

### Phase 2: Custom Nodes (Week 2)
```typescript
// Custom collaborative nodes
const CollaborativeNode = ({ data, selected }) => {
  const currentUser = useUser();
  const collaborators = useQuery(api.canvas.getNodeCollaborators, { 
    nodeId: data.id 
  });

  return (
    <div className={cn(
      "relative rounded-lg border-2 p-4",
      selected && "border-primary",
      data.locked && "opacity-50"
    )}>
      <NodeToolbar>
        <EditButton />
        <DeleteButton />
      </NodeToolbar>
      
      {/* Collaborator avatars */}
      <div className="absolute -top-2 -right-2 flex">
        {collaborators?.map(user => (
          <Avatar key={user.id} user={user} />
        ))}
      </div>
      
      {/* Node content */}
      <div>{data.content}</div>
      
      <Handle type="source" position={Position.Bottom} />
      <Handle type="target" position={Position.Top} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Phase 3: Real-time Collaboration (Week 3)
```typescript
// Real-time cursor tracking and presence
function CollaborativeCanvas() {
  const { user } = useUser();
  const presence = usePresence();
  
  const onMouseMove = (event) => {
    const position = screenToFlowPosition(event);
    presence.update({ cursor: position });
  };

  return (
    <ReactFlow onMouseMove={onMouseMove}>
      <CursorOverlay users={presence.others} />
      <SelectionSync />
      <LiveEdgePreview />
    </ReactFlow>
  );
}
```

### Phase 4: Migration from Current CanvasCollab (Week 4)
1. Map existing canvas node structure to React Flow format
2. Migrate custom node components
3. Implement backward compatibility layer
4. Add feature parity for existing functionality
5. Gradual rollout with feature flags

### Performance Optimization Tips
```typescript
// 1. Memoize custom nodes
const CustomNode = memo(({ data }) => {
  return <div>{data.label}</div>;
});

// 2. Use node extent for viewport limits
<ReactFlow nodeExtent={[[-1000, -1000], [1000, 1000]]}>

// 3. Throttle real-time updates
const throttledUpdate = useThrottle(updateNode, 100);

// 4. Implement viewport culling for large graphs
const visibleNodes = useMemo(() => 
  nodes.filter(node => isInViewport(node, viewport)),
  [nodes, viewport]
);

// 5. Lazy load node components
const NodeComponent = lazy(() => import('./CustomNode'));
```
